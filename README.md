**Step-12)** Now create a project directory.
```bash
mkdir gmail_api
cd gmail_api
```

**Step-13)** Create a virtual environment and activate it.
```bash
python3 -m venv venv/
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Step-14)** Install the Google client library for Python.
```bash
pip3 install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
```

**Step-15)** Move the client secret (`client_secrets.json`) downloaded in step 8 to `gmail_api/` directory and do not share this file anywhere else since your Gmail account can be accessed by anyone using these credentials.

**Step-16)** Create a new python file inside `gmail_api/` titled `send_mail.py`
```code
